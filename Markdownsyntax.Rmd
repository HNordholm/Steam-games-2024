# Intro
This analysis explores a dataset of the top 1500 games on Steam by revenue from (January 1 2024) to (September 9 2024). Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed using ggplot2 to understand relationships among review scores, prices, and copies sold. Additionally,correlation analysis and also hypothesis testing was conducted to determine whether games released in the first quarter tend to have higher sales compared to those released in the second quarter. This document includes the processes of data cleansing, wrangling, visualization, and statistical testing to derive insights from raw data.

# Solution summary

The correlation analysis revealed that games with high sales volumes (bin: 38,313 and above) are positively correlated with price ranges above $19.99 USD, suggesting that less expensive games are less popular on Steam. Additionally, games published by AA and AAA publishers show a positive correlation with high sales volumes, whereas Indie publishers exhibit a negative correlation. The highest average sales are observed in April, February, and March. Non-parametric hypothesis testing, conducted due to non-normal distribution of the sales data, found no significant evidence that games released in the first quarter have higher sales compared to those in the second quarter, especially considering that the full yearâ€™s sales data is incomplete.
